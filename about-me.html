    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Chanda Shekhar Yadav, a passionate 3D artist with a keen eye for detail and a love for bringing creative visions to life. I specialize in animation, motion designing, texturing and have hands-on experience with tools such as Blender Cascadeur .

        My journey into 3D art began with second year of B.Sc., and since then, I’ve been dedicated to honing my craft through various projects, including Aizawa equation visulisation in Space. My work often explores complex math equation and motion design.
        
        In addition to my artistic pursuits, I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles and practices. Specifically, I specialize in ethical hacking, network security. Through my experience in this field, I have developed a keen analytical mind and a detail-oriented approach, which enables me to effectively analyze and resolve complex problems.
